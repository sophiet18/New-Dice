yay me! This time I first created one dice following along the tutorial.
I learnt that **private** means something is only accessible in that class,

finally understood what **functions and arguments** meant and so proud that I no longer have to copy a tutorial to get it 

**random()** function is super useful and takes anything from an integer to items on a list ~ 

ðŸŽ‰Celebrating small milestones - still ecstatic that I successfully challenged myself and completed the practices by not only adding an extra dice but one that displayed different results

woot woot! Learnt about adding conditionals to the dice AND most importantly I solved the SSL connection issue that's been bugging me for so long! 
Learnt about if-else conditions and when statements. I think the latter would be more commonly used for good coding practices and keeping the console efficacious
