yay me! This time I first created one dice following along the tutorial.
I learnt that **private** means something is only accessible in that class and **refreshed** my understanding of what entails in a function, the variables. 
Celebrating small milestones - still ecstatic that I successfully challenged myself and completed the practices by not only adding an extra dice but one that displayed different results
