**mar 23**

yay me! This time I first created one dice following along the tutorial.
I learnt that **private** means something is only accessible in that class,

finally understood what **functions and arguments** meant and so proud that I no longer have to copy a tutorial to get it 

**random()** function is super useful and takes anything from an integer to items on a list ~ 

ðŸŽ‰Celebrating small milestones - still ecstatic that I successfully challenged myself and completed the practices by not only adding an extra dice but one that displayed different results
